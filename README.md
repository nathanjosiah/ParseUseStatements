Nathanjosiah/ParseUseStatements
======

This library is extracted from [PhpReflection](https://github.com/nette/di/blob/ed1b90255688b08b87ae641f2bf1dfcba586ae5b/src/DI/PhpReflection.php) class from [nette/di](https://packagist.org/packages/nette/di).
The original class is marked as internal and therefore BC can be broken at any time. Also installing whole nette/di package means installing a lot of unnecessary boilerplate for just this feature - hence this package.

Go say thank you to [the original author](https://davidgrudl.com/) and [contributors](https://github.com/nette/di/graphs/contributors) for me.
